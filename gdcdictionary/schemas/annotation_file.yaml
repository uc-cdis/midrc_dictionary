# ## NEW PROPERTIES for v1.1.7 (updated 2023-5-23)
  annotation_name:
    description: The name of the annotation. These names are unique and assigned by MIDRC. Annotation names reference a document posted on the MIDRC website describing the annotation, methods and values expected.  All MIDRC created annotations start with "midrc_".
    enum:
        - midrc_mdai_chestxr
        - mRALE_Mastermind_Challenge

  annotation_method:
    description: Defines the method by which the annotation was created. Clinically_derived - Based on information produced in the process of the subject's medical care; Retrospective_expert - Based on information produced retrospective to the subject's care by annotators with relevant special clinical expertise; Retrospective_general - Based on information produced retrospective to the subject's care by annotators without relevant special clinical expertise; Retrospective_auto - Based on information produced retrospective to the subject's care using automated means.
    enum:
        - Clinically_derived
        - Retrospective_expert
        - Retrospective_general

  annotator_id:
    description: Coded value to represent a particular annotator in a group. These need only be unique per annotation.
    type: string

  instance_uids:
    description: Used to denote that this annotation applies only to specific images (image instances) in a series.  When absent, the annotation when referencing an imaging series node applies to the entire imaging series.
