  PhaseEncodingDirection:
    description: Possible values are i, j, k, i-, j-, k-. The letters i, j, k correspond
      to the first, second and third axis of the data in the NIFTI file. The polarity
      of the phase encoding is assumed to go from zero index to maximum index unless
      - sign is present (then the order is reversed - starting from the highest index
      instead of zero). PhaseEncodingDirection is defined as the direction along which
      phase is was modulated which may result in visible distortions. Note that this
      is not the same as the DICOM term InPlanePhaseEncodingDirection which can have
      ROW or COL values. This parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding fieldmap data
      is present or when using multiple runs with different phase encoding directions
      (which can be later used for field inhomogeneity correction).

      acquired) in case of sparse acquisition schemes. This value needs to be consistent
      with the pixdim[4] field (after accounting for units stored in xyzt_units field)
      in the NIfTI header. This field is mutually exclusive with VolumeTiming and
      is derived from DICOM Tag 0018, 0080 and converted to seconds.
